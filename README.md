## Architecture

### Plugin System

findneedle features a flexible plugin system that allows users to extend and customize how logs are processed and searched. Plugins can be developed independently and integrated with the application to add new functionality, such as custom log parsers, advanced filtering, or integration with external tools.

- **How it works:**  
  Plugins are loaded at runtime and can interact with the application via well-defined interfaces. This enables developers to add or modify features without changing the core codebase.

- **Creating a Plugin:**  
  To create a plugin, implement the required interface (see the `/plugins` directory for examples) and register your plugin with the application. The system will automatically detect and initialize available plugins on startup.

### Input, Output, and Processor System

findneedle is architected around three main extensible component types: Inputs, Outputs, and Processors.

#### Inputs

Inputs are responsible for acquiring data (such as log files) and feeding them into the processing pipeline. Examples include reading from local files, directories, or even remote sources.

#### Processors

Processors take the raw input data and apply transformations or analyses. This can include parsing, filtering, or enriching log entries. Multiple processors can be chained to build complex processing pipelines.

#### Outputs

Outputs handle the final presentation or export of processed data. This could mean displaying search results in the UI, writing them to a file, or exporting them to another system.

- **Customizing Components:**  
  Each component type (Input, Processor, Output) can be extended via plugins. This allows for a highly customizable and modular workflow. For example, you could write a plugin processor to anonymize sensitive data, or a custom output to format results for a specific dashboard.
